HOW TO USE NURSE.C (November 3, 2004)

This program is designed to convert DPI stimulus files (.stm, .sen) into 
.sen files that can be used in EyeDoctor (David Stracuzzi's program).

You need one .sen file for each counterbalancing condition of your experiment.
Here's how you get your .sen files:

1. Copy copy nurse.c from c:\data into your directory.

2. Insert your "pickone" code from your experiment running program
between the "your code starts here" and the "your code ends here" lines.
Do NOT include any code that displays text on the screen, accepts responses,
or changes CCOND or CTRIAL. (E.g., do not include eye_disp_sample_store(),
question_any_sentence(), waitt(), next_trial(), etc.)

3. Still in your directory, compile the program with etcc.bat (etcc nurse.c).
You may want to change the value of MAXLINEN if you have really really long
passages.

4. Run the program one time for each counterbalancing condition. Answer the
questions (largest condition, Y offset, etc.; say 'n' when it asks you for 
data file name). Each time you run it, save the output .sen file with a
distinctive name (e.g. mycond1.sen).

5. If you have a display change, the program will ask you for the character 
you used to delimit the display change material. It will delete this material
when it reads material from your .stm file. (OK FOR DISPLAY CHANGE; NOT YET
COMPLETE FOR FAST PRIMING.)


6. Check the output. Each line should start with something like
{cc ii}
where cc is cond number, ii is item number, and then continue with the
material for that condition anditem combination. 

7. EyeDoctor will ask you for the name of the .sen file after you have 
told it to import a .dat format file.

All this is still in the process of being debugged. Please let Chuck know
of any problems you encounter.
